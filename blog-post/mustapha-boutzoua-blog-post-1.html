                    <p>⭕𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘀 𝗜𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜𝘀 𝗜𝘁 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁?⭕ <br>
                        📌Everyone is talking about accessibility - accessible websites and accessible forms. But other than a general idea of what people are referring to, 𝗱𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲𝗯 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 - 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆, 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁?  <br> 
                        <br>
                        
                        In this article, we cover the main whats, whos, and whys, of accessibility✅. We explain in detail what accessibility is, who is affected by websites that aren’t accessible, and why your business needs to ensure your forms are fully-accessible to your audience.  <br> <br>
                        
                        Let’s get started… <br>
                        𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆? <br>
                        When defining web accessibility, the Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has written that “Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them”.  <br>  <br> 
                        
                        However, ‘disability’ doesn’t just refer to people with sight or hearing loss (which is often people’s first thoughts when it comes to web accessibility).   <br> <br>
                        
                        The mission of W3C is to “make the web available to all people, whatever their hardware, software, network infrastructure, native language, culture, geographical location, or physical or mental ability.’   <br>  <br>
                        
                        By ensuring all websites are accessible to all, the internet becomes fair and inclusive, allowing everyone access to the content, information, and opportunities that the web provides. As Web accessibility experts Level Level argues that “Everyone benefits from improved web accessibility.”  <br>  <br>
                        
                        So what might prevent people from accessing the web? Let’s find out...   <br>  <br>
                        
                        𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗠𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗲𝗯?   <br>  <br>
                        
                        Over 20% of all people using the web will have issues fully accessing the websites and the content they need.   <br>  <br>
                        
                        Accessibility encompasses a broad range of issues that affect access to the web - from disabilities, including temporary disabilities, to situational limitations, and issues with technology or the internet. Let’s take a look... 
                        <br>  <br> 
                        Disabilities:  <br>  <br>
                        
                        📌𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 - Blindness and other visual impairments including cataract, glaucoma, and color-blindness can all affect how well users are able to access websites. <br>
                        📌𝗔𝘂𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 - There are a diverse range of hearing impairments that can affect web accessibility, from profound deafness to loss of hearing in old age. <br>
                        📌 𝗖𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲- This can involve issues with memory, language, thinking, and judgement, which can all affect web navigation. <br>
                        📌𝗣𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹- Mobility and physical impairments can prevent users from easily browsing the web or inputting data. <br>
                        These are just some of the disabilities that can impact a user's access to the web. Further web accessibility issues include: 
                        <br> <br>
                        📌𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 - Broken bones, lost glasses, tiredness, this list is endless! <br>
                        Situational Limitations - Bright sunlight, time restrictions, a situation where you can’t listen to audio, etc. <br>
                        📌𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 - Mobiles, smartwatches, and other devices with small screens or using old technology, as well as assistive technology including screen readers and speech operated software, all alter a user’s web experience. <br>
                        📌𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁 - Slow internet, poor connection, or limited bandwidth quickly restricts web accessibility.  <br> <br>
                        
                        𝗔𝗿𝗴𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 <br>
                        Accessibility is an important issue for many different reasons and on many levels. These include: Ethical, Business, and Legal.  <br> <br>
                        
                        Let’s take a look at each of these in turn...  <br> <br>
                        
                        ⚠️𝗘𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 <br>
                        The first, and key argument for accessibility, takes an ethical standpoint.  <br>  <br>
                        
                        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community - it’s guiding vision is to ‘lead the Web to its full potential.’ As in the physical world, the W3C is working towards a fair and inclusive web for all, whatever your individual situation or needs.   <br>  <br>
                        
                        When the web is fully accessible, barriers that prevent people with disabilities contributing to, or joining in with, the physical world are removed. Full web accessibility also ensures that everyone has the same opportunities and are treated equally online - something that we should all be striving toward!  <br> <br>
                        
                        ⚠️𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 <br>
                        If the ethical standpoint isn’t enough to win you over on the importance of web accessibility, then the business case for accessibility may help. As mentioned, on average 20% of all people who visit your website will have issues accessing your content - if your site is inaccessible, that is a lot of potential customers that you have missed out on. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Accessible websites also perform better across the board too. By using universal design strategies (strategies that ensure everyone can access your site) your site becomes more user friendly to all, not just those with disabilities.  <br> <br>
                        
                        This will ultimately improve your site’s performance - whether this is communicating messages and information more clearly, streamlining site navigation, collecting leads, or generating revenue.  <br> <br>
                        
                        ⚠️𝗟𝗲𝗴𝗮𝗹 <br>
                        Lastly, there is a very strong legal argument for accessibility. If your website isn’t fully accessible then it could be considered discriminatory towards those with disabilities. Depending on your country and state, and where your audience is located, this could leave you open to lawsuits.  <br> <br>
                        
                        You will find that laws on accessible websites differ greatly - for example, Government and public sector websites have to adhere to much stricter accessibility laws than some other industries. However, it is crucial that you research accessibility laws and guidelines in your country and for your business sector to ensure that your site is complying with regulations - and make the necessary changes if not. 
                        <br> <br>
                        𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝘆 <br>
                        W3C has produced Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (known as WCAG 2.1) which are internationally recognized guidelines for improving web accessibility. These guidelines are extensive, and you may need to work with accessibility professionals to get your website up to scratch. <br> <br>
                        However, below we share a few top tips to help you make your website more accessible right away…  <br> <br>
                        
                        ✅𝗔𝗱𝗱 𝗔𝗹𝘁 𝗧𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 - Alternative text replaces the image if an image fails to load. However, it is also used by screen readers to help users ‘read’ the image. Therefore, when filling out the Alt text, make sure it clearly describes the graphic. <br>
                        ✅𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗡𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘀 - Links should always be underlined and given a meaningful name so screen readers can easily identify the links within the content. <br>
                        ✅𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗩𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗼 - Captions, transcripts, and other text alternatives for video and audio on your site will ensure that users with visual and auditory impairments can still access the content. <br>
                        ✅𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘆 - Make sure the colors on your site contrast well so it is possible for everyone to distinguish between different content elements on your page. It is also important not to use color alone to convey information. For example, a form that uses color to identify a required field should also use some other kind of indicator - ie, an asterisk - so all users can see which fields are required for form submission. <br>
                        ✅𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮, 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗼𝘂𝘁 - Tables used for layout purposes can cause confusion for visitors using screen readers. Limit table use to data only, and follow these W3C Table Guidelines. <br>
                        ✅𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿 - It is essential that the forms on your website are accessible to all your visitors, enabling users to get in contact, sign up to a service, purchase products, and any other action that includes entering their data and submitting a form. Using a form builder that has the functionality to allow you to create accessible forms is a must for all websites</p>
